# Sv2 Protocol Coverage

This document formally describes how `interoperability-tests-sv2` covers the [Stratum V2 Protocol Specification](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec).

§ indicates spec sections.

## Scenarios

A **Scenario** is a single testable Sv2 Protocol behavior — each describes a failure mode, its spec basis, and how a client detects it.

Scenarios are application-agnostic: each row describes a generic Sv2 Protocol behavior, which might potentially happen under different application contexts.

### How scenarios are organized

The catalog is organized **one table per spec message**, mirroring the spec's own structure. A **General** section covers cross-cutting invariants that have no single home message (framing, error codes, channel/job namespaces, liveness).

**Anchor rule:** each scenario is filed under the message whose spec section carries the normative requirement it tests. Scenarios frequently involve a longer session with other messages; the `Involves` column lists them so the scenario remains discoverable from every message it touches.

**Symmetric split**: scenarios that apply to both a standard and extended message pair are separate scenarios with separate IDs — they exercise different server code paths and are covered independently per suite.

**One failure mode per scenario**: a row describes a single way a server can fail. Failures that have different spec bases, or that a server can exhibit independently of each other, are separate scenarios even when one probe could exercise both.

**Scenario IDs** are `<PROTO>-<MSG>-<n>` where `PROTO` ∈ `GEN` (cross-cutting), `C` (common), `M` (mining), `JD` (job declaration), `TD` (template distribution). Extension scenarios use `X<extid>-<MSG>-<n>` (e.g. `X0001-REQS-1` for extension `0x0001`). IDs are unique, stable references: new scenarios append; existing IDs are never renumbered or reused. IDs prefixed `JD-`/`TD-` are reserved for future suite expansion.

## Suites

A **Suite** targets one protocol role defined in [§3](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/03-Protocol-Overview.md#3-protocol-overview) and covers the scenarios an implementation of that role must pass. Deployments map onto roles: a pool, a solo pool, a proxy and a Job Declarator Client all act as a **Mining Protocol Server** toward their downstream. Scenarios that only apply when the target uses an optional feature (group channels, extensions, proxy forwarding) say so in their row instead of living in a separate suite. The [**Suite Coverage**](#suite-coverage) table below tracks which scenarios are implemented per suite.

## Compliance Tiers

**Compliance Tiers** classify scenarios by how severely a failure undermines Sv2 compliance.

- **Ω1 — non-compliant.** An application failing any Ω1 scenario is fundamentally broken and does not meet the Sv2 protocol specification.
- **Ω2 — interoperability-critical.** Meaningful edge cases that might hurt interoperability, but are not direct protocol violations.
- **Ω3 — robustness.** Miscellaneous non-critical corner cases.

**Assignment rule.** A scenario's tier follows the spec text behind it.

- **Ω1** when the spec states the requirement on the server. That covers a MUST / MUST NOT addressed to the server, and an unambiguous statement of server behavior, such as "will be rejected", "can be sent only to", or a field defined as echoing the request.
- **Ω2** when the spec only says SHOULD / SHOULD NOT, or when the requirement is derived from other text without being stated. The `Spec basis` column then says *derived*. A MUST addressed to the client lands here when the scenario tests that the server rejects input violating it: a server that tolerates the violation breaks no obligation of its own.
- **Ω3** when no spec text exists and the scenario captures expected behavior only.

This list might grow as the project matures.

## Testability Tiers

**Testability Tiers** classify scenarios by the type of assertion required.

- **Θ1 — Protocol conformance.** Pure message-level assertions: framing, negotiation, channel open, message ordering, invalid-share rejection, channel lifecycle.
- **Θ2 — Valid-share accounting.** The test client grinds real shares meeting the *channel* target and asserts acceptance / rejection and batch-accounting semantics. Every scenario whose failure mode is a share being *accepted* is Θ2: a random hash gets `SubmitShares.Error` from any server, so acceptance is only observable with an otherwise-valid share.

Some scenarios depend on something only the server decides: sending `SetExtranoncePrefix` or `SetGroupChannel`, closing a channel, setting a flag in `SetupConnection.Success`, engaging with extension negotiation. Others depend on the network, such as a new block arriving. The test client cannot provoke any of these; the `Detection` column says so, and a run in which the precondition never occurs reports the scenario as *not exercised*, never as passed.

This list might grow as the project matures.

| C-SC-8 | Ω1 | Θ1 | Server accepts `SetupConnection` with no supported version in the offered range (e.g. `(3,3)`, `(3,2)`, `(1,1)`) or closes without first sending `SetupConnection.Error` | [§3.6.1](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/03-Protocol-Overview.md#361-setupconnection-client---server) "If the server supports no protocol version between `min_version` and `max_version` inclusive, it MUST respond with `SetupConnection.Error`" | Send version ranges with no overlap with 2; assert framed `SetupConnection.Error` before TCP close | `SetupConnection.Error` |

| M-NEMJ-9 | Ω1 | Θ2 | Server sends `NewExtendedMiningJob` with `version_rolling_allowed = False` but accepts a share whose BIP323 general-purpose version bits differ from the job | [§5.3.16](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5316-newextendedminingjob-server---client) "If set to False, the downstream node MUST use version as it is defined by this message, and the upstream node MUST reject shares for this job whose `version` differs from it" | Grind a valid share after modifying only the BIP323 general-purpose version bits; assert `SubmitShares.Error` (only if the server sends a job with `version_rolling_allowed = False`) | `SubmitSharesExtended`, `SubmitShares.Error` |
| M-NEMJ-10 | Ω1 | Θ1 | Active extended job arrives with `ntime_start` lower than the `ntime_start` of the most recent `SetNewPrevHash` (job mined against that `prev_hash`) | [§5.3.16](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5316-newextendedminingjob-server---client) "When set, `ntime_start` MUST NOT be lower than the `ntime_start` of the most recent `SetNewPrevHash` applicable to the channel" | After `SetNewPrevHash` activates a job, assert every subsequent active job's `ntime_start >= SetNewPrevHash.ntime_start` | `SetNewPrevHash` |

#### `SetNewPrevHash` ([§5.3.17](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5317-setnewprevhash-server---client-broadcast))

| Scenario IDs | Compliance tier | Testability tier | Failure mode | Spec basis | Detection | Involves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M-SNPH-1 | Ω1 | Θ1 | `SetNewPrevHash` activates a `job_id` never sent as a future job | [§5.3.17](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5317-setnewprevhash-server---client-broadcast) "The server MUST NOT send this message referencing a `job_id` that was not previously sent as a future job (i.e. with `ntime_start` unset) on the corresponding channel" | Cross-reference announced future jobs | `NewMiningJob`, `NewExtendedMiningJob` |
| M-SNPH-2 | Ω2 | Θ2 | Mining Protocol Server keeps accepting shares for jobs invalidated by a `SetNewPrevHash` (stale acceptance → wrong accounting, misleading hashrate) | [§5.3.17](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5317-setnewprevhash-server---client-broadcast) "Shares submitted for jobs invalidated by a previous `SetNewPrevHash` (stale shares) SHOULD be rejected by the server" | After a new block triggers a later `SetNewPrevHash`, submit an otherwise-valid share (meets the channel target) for a job it invalidated; expect `SubmitShares.Error` (only if a new block arrives during the run) | `SubmitShares.Error`, `SubmitShares.Success` |
| M-SNPH-3 | Ω1 | Θ1 | `ntime_start` in `SetNewPrevHash` not consensus-valid for the block following `prev_hash` (≤ chain median-time-past, or beyond `MAX_FUTURE_BLOCK_TIME`) → any block found would be invalid | [§5.3.17](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5317-setnewprevhash-server---client-broadcast) "The server MUST ensure that `ntime_start` is a consensus-valid nTime for the block following `prev_hash` (in particular, greater than that chain's median-time-past)" | Sanity-bound assertion in both directions | — |

#### `SetCustomMiningJob`, `SetCustomMiningJob.Success`, `SetCustomMiningJob.Error` ([§5.3.18](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5318-setcustomminingjob-client---server), [§5.3.19](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5319-setcustomminingjobsuccess-server---client), [§5.3.20](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5320-setcustomminingjoberror-server---client))

Deferred until a Job Declarator Server suite exists: exercising these messages requires the test client to play the Job Declarator Client against the target's Job Declarator Server. No scenarios yet.

#### `SetTarget` ([§5.3.21](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5321-settarget-server---client))

| Scenario IDs | Compliance tier | Testability tier | Failure mode | Spec basis | Detection | Involves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M-ST-1 | Ω1 | Θ1 | `SetTarget.target` above the `max_target` most recently accepted for the channel (from channel open, or the last accepted `UpdateChannel`) | [§5.3.21](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5321-settarget-server---client) "MUST NOT exceed the `max_target` of the most recent `UpdateChannel` the server accepted for the channel or, if there has been none, of the `OpenStandardMiningChannel` or `OpenExtendedMiningChannel` that opened it" | Assert bound on every `SetTarget`. After lowering `max_target` via `UpdateChannel`: a target above the previous `max_target` is a violation at any time; a target above the new `max_target` is a violation only once the grace period has expired without an `UpdateChannel.Error` | `OpenStandardMiningChannel`, `OpenExtendedMiningChannel`, `UpdateChannel`, `UpdateChannel.Error` |
| M-ST-2 | Ω1 | Θ2 | Mining Protocol Server applies new target retroactively to active jobs that had `ntime_start` set | [§5.3.21](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5321-settarget-server---client) "not applicable for already received jobs with `ntime_start=nTime`" | Grind a share valid under the old target on a pre-`SetTarget` job; assert old target applies | `NewMiningJob`, `SubmitSharesStandard` |
| M-ST-3 | Ω1 | Θ2 | A `SetTarget` update for one channel (individual, not group) changes validation on another independent channel | [§5.2](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#52-channel) "All Channels are independent of each other" | Open channels A and B, reduce A's target via `UpdateChannel`; grind and submit a share on B valid under B's unchanged target; assert `SubmitShares.Success` | `UpdateChannel`, `SubmitSharesStandard`, `SubmitSharesExtended`, `SubmitShares.Success` |
| M-ST-4 | Ω1 | Θ1 | `SetTarget` addressed to a group channel carries a `target` above the most recently accepted `max_target` of at least one member channel | [§5.3.21](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5321-settarget-server---client) "When `SetTarget` is sent to a group channel, the target is applicable to all channels in the group, and the bound above applies to each of them" | Open channels with different `max_target`s that the server groups; on every group-addressed `SetTarget` assert the M-ST-1 bound against each member (only if the server uses groups) | `SetGroupChannel`, `OpenStandardMiningChannel`, `OpenExtendedMiningChannel`, `UpdateChannel` |

#### `SetGroupChannel` ([§5.3.22](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5322-setgroupchannel-server---client))

| Scenario IDs | Compliance tier | Testability tier | Failure mode | Spec basis | Detection | Involves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| M-SGC-1 | Ω1 | Θ1 | `SetGroupChannel` sent on a connection with `REQUIRES_STANDARD_JOBS` | [§5.3.22](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5322-setgroupchannel-server---client) "can be sent only to connections that don't have REQUIRES_STANDARD_JOBS" | Assert absence (only if the server accepts `REQUIRES_STANDARD_JOBS`) | `SetupConnection` |
| M-SGC-2 | Ω1 | Θ1 | `group_channel_id` collides with an existing mining `channel_id` | [§5.2.3](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#523-group-channel), [§5.3.22](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/05-Mining-Protocol.md#5322-setgroupchannel-server---client) "MUST ensure that a group channel has a unique channel ID" | Cross-check ID spaces (only if the server uses groups) | `OpenStandardMiningChannel.Success`, `OpenExtendedMiningChannel.Success` |

### Protocol Extensions ([§3.4](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/03-Protocol-Overview.md#34-protocol-extensions))

One subsection per registered extension; future registrations append new subsections. Generic extension machinery (unknown `extension_type` handling, TLV invariants, negotiation-before-use) lives in the [General](#general-3135-5152-8) table as GEN-6…GEN-11.

**Applicability caveat:** a server that implements no extensions is compliant — it simply ignores `RequestExtensions`. Therefore *no response* to `RequestExtensions` is not a failure; the `X0001-*` scenarios below only apply once a server engages with the negotiation protocol.

#### Extension `0x0001` — [Extensions Negotiation](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/extensions/0x0001-extensions-negotiation.md)

##### `RequestExtensions`

| Scenario IDs | Compliance tier | Testability tier | Failure mode | Spec basis | Detection | Involves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| X0001-REQ-1 | Ω2 | Θ1 | Server requires extensions the client didn't request, but keeps the connection open after the client doesn't retry | ext `0x0001` [§4](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/extensions/0x0001-extensions-negotiation.md#4-implementation-notes) example 6 "If the client does not retry with the required extension, the server MUST disconnect the client" (derived: the MUST appears only in a worked example, not in the Error Handling notes) | Omit a server-required extension from the request; do not retry; assert disconnect (only if the server requires an extension) | `RequestExtensions.Error` |

##### `RequestExtensions.Success`

| Scenario IDs | Compliance tier | Testability tier | Failure mode | Spec basis | Detection | Involves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| X0001-REQS-1 | Ω1 | Θ1 | `request_id` doesn't echo the request | ext `0x0001` [§2](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/extensions/0x0001-extensions-negotiation.md#2-messages-defined-by-this-extension) `request_id` "Unique identifier for pairing the response" | Random `request_id`s; assert pairing | — |
| X0001-REQS-2 | Ω1 | Θ1 | Extension-defined message framed with the wrong `extension_type` (must be `0x0001`, not `0x0000`) | [§3.4.1](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/03-Protocol-Overview.md#341-extension-type-field-usage) "MUST have `extension_type` set to the identifier of the extension that introduced them", ext `0x0001` [§3](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/extensions/0x0001-extensions-negotiation.md#3-message-types) | Assert `extension_type == 0x0001` (after masking `channel_msg` bit) on every negotiation frame | `RequestExtensions.Error` |
| X0001-REQS-3 | Ω2 | Θ1 | `RequestExtensions.Success.supported_extensions` contains extension IDs that were not in the client's request | ext `0x0001` [§1](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/extensions/0x0001-extensions-negotiation.md#1-overview) (derived — negotiation semantics: Success confirms which of the requested extensions are supported) | Request a known set of extensions; assert `supported_extensions` ⊆ requested set | — |

##### `RequestExtensions.Error`

| Scenario IDs | Compliance tier | Testability tier | Failure mode | Spec basis | Detection | Involves |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| X0001-REQE-1 | Ω1 | Θ1 | None of the requested extensions are supported, but server doesn't respond with `RequestExtensions.Error` | ext `0x0001` [§4](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/extensions/0x0001-extensions-negotiation.md#4-implementation-notes) ("MUST respond with `RequestExtensions.Error` if none of the requested extensions are supported") | Request only unallocated extension IDs; assert `Error` | — |
| X0001-REQE-2 | Ω1 | Θ1 | `Error` contents wrong: `unsupported_extensions` ≠ the requested-but-unsupported set | ext `0x0001` [§1.1](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/extensions/0x0001-extensions-negotiation.md#11-negotiating-extensions) "identifying unsupported extensions and required extensions from the responder", [§4](https://github.com/stratum-mining/sv2-spec/blob/main/extensions/0x0001-extensions-negotiation.md#4-implementation-notes) | Request a mix of supported and bogus IDs; assert exact unsupported set | — |
